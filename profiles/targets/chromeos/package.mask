# TODO: ARM is temporarily stuck on mesa-7.5.1-r1 but x86 uses a newer

# The following are here because we override the ebuilds from the
# portage tree for a reason other than adding an ebuild from upstream
# that wasn't yet in our portage tree. We want to keep using our
# version of these packages even if a newer stable version becomes
# available in portage:

# Required patch; pending work to upstream.
