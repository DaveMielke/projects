Disable gcc linker PIE support with copy reloc.
This feature was enabled with binutils 2.27 upgrade but breaks libbrillo
unittests with gcc.
This is because of the upstream gcc bug for which the patches were not
backported to 4.9.x branches.
https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=65248
This can be removed once patches for the bug are backported to CroS
GCC 4.9.2 branch.
