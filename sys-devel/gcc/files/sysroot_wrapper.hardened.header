# This script is a meta-driver for the toolchain. It transforms the command
# line to allow the following:
# 1. This script ensures that '--sysroot' is passed to whatever it is wrapping.
#
# 2. It adds hardened flags to gcc invocation. The hardened flags are:
#   -fstack-protector-strong
#   -fPIE
#   -pie
#   -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2
#
# It can disable -fPIE -pie by checking if -nopie is passed to gcc. In this
# case it removes -nopie as it is a non-standard flag.
#
# 3. Enable clang diagnostics with -clang-syntax option
#
# 4. Add new -print-cmdline option to print the command line before executon
#
# 5. Enable clang codegen.
# This is currently implemented as two loops on the list of arguments. The
# first loop # identifies hardening flags, as well as determining if clang
# invocation is specified. The second loop build command line for clang
# invocation as well adjusting gcc command line.
#
# This implementation ensure compile time of default path remains mostly
# the same.
#
# There is a similar hardening wrapper that wraps ld and adds -z now -z relro
# to the link command line (see ldwrapper).
#
# To use:
#   mv <tool> <tool>.real
#   ln -s <path_to_sysroot_wrapper> <tool>
