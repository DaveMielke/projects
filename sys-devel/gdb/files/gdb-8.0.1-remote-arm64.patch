Incorporating patch from https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=13984
to deal with similar issue.

Note 1. This patch has been proposed to fix the problem, but not actually
accepted upstream.

Note 2. This is an ugly hack/workaround, but I can't create a better patch
at the moment, due to the difficulties in reproducing the issue.  This is
to fix https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=630015
