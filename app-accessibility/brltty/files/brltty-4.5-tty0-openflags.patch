On ChromeOS, brltty is run as its own user instead of root.
It has group memberships to allow it access to the tty.
This patch changes an open call so that /dev/tty0 is only opened for
writing (it just issues some ioctl calls on the device), which is necessary
because the tty group only has write access to /dev/tty0.
