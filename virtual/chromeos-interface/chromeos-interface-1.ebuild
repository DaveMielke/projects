DESCRIPTION="Generic ebuild which satisifies virtual/chromeos-interface.
This is a direct dependency of chromeos-base/chromeos, but can
be overridden in an overlay for specialized boards.

To satisfy this virtual, a package should cause to be installed everything
a user would need to interact with the system locally."
