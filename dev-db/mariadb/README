This is the Chromium OS copy of the MariaDB ebuild. The primary user
is currently the Moblab Project therefore there has been a series of
Moblab specific changes to this ebuild.

General Changes:
* The original upstream ebuild had a lot of difficulties finding the
  correct libbfd libraries therefore the ebuild was modified to find
  the correct libbfd libaries at build time and ensures that libaio
  and libbfd are included in the built image.

* Overrode mysql-v2_pkg_setup so that it uses the GID/UID defined in
  the profile. https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/#/c/186924/

Moblab Specific Changes:
* Updated my.cnf to remove the max size on the InnoDB datafile.

* Reduced innodb_buffer_pool_size to 8M and
  innodb_additional_mem_pool_size to 1M. These changes reduces mysqld's
  memory footprint from 1.2GB to 750MB.
