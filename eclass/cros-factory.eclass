# @ECLASS-VARIABLE: CROS_FACTORY_BOARD_RESOURCES_DIR
# @DESCRIPTION: Folder of factory resources to current board.
: ${CROS_FACTORY_BOARD_RESOURCES_DIR:=/var/lib/factory/resources}

# @FUNCTION: factory_create_resource
# @USAGE: <name> <local_dir> <resource_dir> <objects...>
# @DESCRIPTION:
# Adds a resource for ChromeOS Factory (chromeos-base/chromeos-factory) to merge
# into build outputs.
#
# <name> is the name of resource archive without file name extension, which
# should be in format $TARGET-$IDENTIFIER. TARGET is the build targets in
# src/platform/factory/Makefile. Currently you can use following targets:
#  toolkit - only included when building toolkit (not in par).
#  par - only included when building par (not in toolkits).
#  resource - included in all targets (toolkit & par).
#  factory - same as resource.
# Defaults to "factory-board" if param is empty.
#
# <local_dir> is the path to where prepared files lives, for example ${WORKDIR}.
# Defaults to "${WORKDIR}" if param is empty.
#
# <resource_dir> is the path to where the files should be located in resource
# file, under /usr/local/factory. For example "py". Defaults to "." if param is
# empty.
#
# <objects> are files or directories to be copied into resource archive.
#
# @EXAMPLE:
# To copy files from ${WORKDIR}/dist/webgl_aquarium_static as
#  /usr/local/factory/py/test/pytests/webgl_aquarium_static/* in resource file
#  ${D}/var/lib/factory/resources/factory-board.tar:
#
# @CODE
#  factory_create_resource factory-board "${WORKDIR}/dist" \
#    py/test/pytests webgl_aquarium_static
# @CODE

	local params="<name> <local_dir> <resource_dir> <objects>..."

	[ -n "${resource_dir}" ] || resource_dir="."

	tar -cf "${archive_dir}/${name}.tar" \

# @FUNCTION: factory_unpack_resource
# @USAGE: <name> [output_dir]
# @DESCRIPTION:
# Unpacks a resource file prepared for ChromeOS Factory
# (chromeos-base/chromeos-factory). See factory_create_resource for more
# details.
#
# <name> is the name of resource archive without file name extension.
#
# [output_dir] is the path to unpack resource contents, for example ${WORKDIR}.
# Defaults to "${WORKDIR}" if param is empty.
#
# @EXAMPLE:
# To extract files from ${EROOT}var/lib/factory/resources/factory-board.tar
# to ${WORKDIR}/py/test/pytests:
#
# @CODE
#  factory_unpack_resource factory-board "${WORKDIR}/py/test/pytests"
# @CODE

	local name="$1"
	local output_dir="${2:-${WORKDIR}}"
	[[ $# -gt 2 ]] && die "Usage: ${FUNCNAME} <name> [output dir]"

	mkdir -p "${output_dir}"
	tar -xvf "${EROOT}${CROS_FACTORY_BOARD_RESOURCES_DIR}/${name}.tar" \
		-C "${output_dir}"
}
