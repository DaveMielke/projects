Subject: [PATCH] dix: don't BUG_WARN for button events from button-only
 device

Events from button-only devices still need coordinates, and they get them
from scale_to_desktop().  Therefore, a dev without valuators is not a bug.
However, a dev with valuators, but less than two of them still is a bug.

This was noticed when unplugging a "Creative Technology SB Arena Headset",
which has some BTNs and some KEYs, but no REL or ABS valuators.
It emits [BTN_3] = 0 on unplug, which would trigger the BUG_WARN.
