DEFINED_PHASES=-
DESCRIPTION=Empty (null) ebuild which satisifies virtual/chromeos-bsp. This is a direct dependency of chromeos-base/chromeos, but is expected to be overridden in an overlay for each specialized board. A typical non-null implementation will install any board-specific configuration files and drivers which are not suitable for inclusion in a generic board overlay.
