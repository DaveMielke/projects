DESCRIPTION=Generic ebuild which satisifies virtual/chromeos-bsp-dev. This is a direct dependency of chromeos-base/chromeos-dev, but is expected to be overridden in an overlay for each specialized board. A typical non-generic implementation will install any board-specific developer only files and executables which are not suitable for inclusion in a generic board overlay.
