DESCRIPTION=Generic ebuild which satisfies virtual/chromeos-bsp-test-root. This package is merged onto the rootfs when an image is modified for test. A typical non-generic implementation will install any board-specific test-only files which are required on the rootfs (such as upstart jobs) but which are not suitable for inclusion in a generic board overlay.
