Updating cmake-utils.eclass causes this build to break due to an intermediate
binary not being visible on the PATH during compilation. This patch specifies
that the binary should be used from the CWD during the build, which resolves
the issue. This patch needs to be included and carried forward until the
upstream bug is resolved.

Upstream bug: https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Loader/issues/249
