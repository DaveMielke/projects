Subject: [PATCH 3/4] xf86-video-intel: Avoid display corruption when unable to
 flip.

This replaces the previous patch to xorg-server for crosbug/33775.
That change avoids calling ScheduleSwap when a flip would not be
classically possible, so interferes with the upcoming per-crtc
flip feature.

BUG=chromium-os:35796
TEST=Rapidly minimize/restore/tile window so that the animation spans
     monitors, observe that none of the preview shadow is left behind.
