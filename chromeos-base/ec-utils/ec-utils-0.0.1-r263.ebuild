# The BOARD is a special parameter. It should be the ChromeOS board name if you
# are building EC firmware itself. However, for utility, we can always build
# the reference configuration "bds" because the protocol should be always
# compliant to reference one.
BOARD="bds"

src_compile() {
	tc-export AR CC RANLIB
	# In platform/ec Makefile, it uses "CC" to specify target chipset and
	# "HOSTCC" to compile the utility program because it assumes developers
	# want to run the utility from same host (build machine).
	# In this ebuild file, we only build utility
	# and we may want to build it so it can
	# be executed on target devices (i.e., arm/x86/amd64), not the build
	# host (BUILDCC, amd64). So we need to override HOSTCC by target "CC".
