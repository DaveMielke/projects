# chromeos-factory-mini is a subset of the factory software that can
# be used to run utilities like gooftool, hwid, and regcode, which may
# be useful in the CrOS test environment.  For instance, this would
# allow "gooftool probe" to be used to probe hardware components in
# Moblab.
#
# We don't want to install the entire chromeos-factory package in the
# test image, since it is quite large, so this package comprises a
# small ".par" file (/usr/local/factory-mini/factory-mini.par)
# containing the necessary subset of factory Python code, and symlinks
# from /usr/local/bin to that file.
