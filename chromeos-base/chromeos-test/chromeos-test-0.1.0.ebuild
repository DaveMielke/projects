# Packages required to support autotest images.  Dependencies here
# are for packages that must be present on a local device and that
# are not downloaded by the autotest server.  This includes both
# packages relied on by the server, as well as packages relied on by
# specific tests.
#
# This package is not meant to capture tools useful for test debug;
# use the chromeos-dev package for that purpose.
#
# Note that some packages used by autotest are actually built by the
# autotest package and downloaded by the server, regardless of
# whether the package is present on the target device; those
# packages aren't listed here.
#
# Developers should be aware that packages installed by this ebuild
# are rooted in /usr/local.  This means that libraries are installed
# in /usr/local/lib, executables in /usr/local/bin, etc.
#
# TODO(jrbarnette):  It's not known definitively that the list
# below contains no unneeded dependencies.  More work is needed to
# determine for sure that every package listed is actually used.
